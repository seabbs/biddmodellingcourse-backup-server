# biddmodellingcourse-backup-server


A backup server for the BIDD Infectious Disease Modelling short course


To initialise the server run the following (after installing [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)),

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Once the server is initialised the course practicals can be found at `your-ip:8787`. 30 course usernames (course-i, with i running from 1 to 30) have been enabled, with matching passwords (i.e. course-i). The app used in the practicals can be found at `your-ip:3838/exploreidmodels`.

Follow the course instructions [here](https://bristolmathmodellers.github.io/biddmodellingcourse/) to complete the course.
